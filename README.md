# Welcome to Pipe Pump V2! 

As an SDE Intern for the AWS CDK last summer, I created Pipe Pump to test out the new CDK Pipelines feature as well as demo my intern project, the CDK Synthetics module. Now, CDK Pipelines is Generally Available (yay!) and the API is significantly different from what it was a year ago. Pipe Pump V2 is thus an update on the original demo utilizing the new and improved CDK Pipelines. Enjoy!

## How To Use

TBD. Check back when I've finished!

## General Structure

The structure of the pipeline is Source -> Build -> Update Pipeline -> Assets -> Sandbox -> Test -> Prod.

The project uses the AWS CDK. The modules used are AWS Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline, AWS Lambda, AWS ApiGateway, AWS Synthetics, and AWS SNS.

Happy Piping!
